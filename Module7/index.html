                <p>Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that harm the optic nerve, essential for vision. This damage is
                    often linked to increased eye pressure but can occur even with normal pressure levels. Signs of
                    glaucoma include seeing halos around lights, vision loss, redness in the eye, and eye pain.</p>

                <p>Though glaucoma can strike at any age, it's more prevalent in older adults, particularly those over
                    60, and is a leading cause of blindness in this age group.</p>

                <p>Glaucoma often goes unnoticed until it's advanced, as it gradually affects vision. Regular eye exams,
                    including eye pressure checks, are crucial for early detection and preventing or slowing vision
                    loss.</p>
